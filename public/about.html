<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>My name is Nicole and I'm new to the field of web development. My journey began when I decided to change career because I wasn't satisfied with my previous job. There was no room for growth. Initially, I decided to delve into digital marketing, but I didn't realize it was just the beginning! As I started to become more interested in website building, I discovered WordPress. However, I felt that I needed something more, so I stumbled upon web development.</p>
